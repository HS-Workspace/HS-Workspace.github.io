## Our team

We have been making plugins for years. Our plugins ranged from simple to complex ones. A lot of them are open-source and free to use. We also have experience in managing Minecraft servers.

Besides that, there is no difference in terms of features and performance between the three packages.

## After-sales

1. 7-days free for minor changes
2. Free bug fixes
3. One major update guarantee

## Payment

Currently, we only accept payment via PayPal.

You have to pay for half of the price before the work can be started, and pay for the rest before receiving the product.

You may not charge-back or dispute any payments made.
